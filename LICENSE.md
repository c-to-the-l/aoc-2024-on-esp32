Man, I dunno? I borrowed a lot of code from the [picoserve](https://github.com/sammhicks/picoserve) and [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) example projects. 

Anything not bearing a resemblance to those projects is mine, I guess. Do whatever you want with it. No implied warranties, and all the other stuff.
